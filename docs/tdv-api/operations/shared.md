Here you can find all of the operations that are shared across Entity types. With some limitations, these endpoints are valid for any Entity. See the detail-pages and the [Entities' Shared Ops]({{site.baseurl}}/entity-system/shared-ops) section of the guide for more info about using the shared operations.
