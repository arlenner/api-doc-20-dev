# JavaScript and the Tradovate API

Welcome to the Tradovate API JavaScript Tutorial Suite! This series of tutorials will explain how to use the Tradovate API from the basics to the most advanced features that we offer. Each section represents a portion of the API and the operations therein. You can run each section in the browser and follow along.

## How to Use This Guide

The easiest way to use this guide is to clone the entire repo. You can then open a command prompt and navigate to any directory under `/tutorial`. Each section is its own standalone web application. Run the following command to install the dependencies for the project:

```
yarn install
```

Once you have your project's dependencies installed, you can run the project using the following:

```
yarn start
```

This will open the project in a browser for you to hack away at.
